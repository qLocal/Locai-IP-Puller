# Locai-IP-Puller
Application to quickly retrieve roblox server ip's without needing to take the time to enter each txt file to find it yourself.

In no way do i encourage using this for exploitable purposes although I have no say in what you do with it. 


# Instructions

# 1 
Open the .exe file in Initialize > Content > Bin > Debug and join a roblox game, leaving doesn't effect the process
# 2
Press 'Retrieve Server IP' on the application
# 3
The IP and Port will appear in the two text boxes for you to commit actions with.
